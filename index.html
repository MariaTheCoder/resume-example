                As my client portfolio has grown, I have more report building to
                do and fewer bookkeeping related tasks. I also assisted clients
                with COVID-19 compensation packages. Additionally I have
                assisted with collecting information on all clients in respect
                to the laws about Anti Money Laundring and Anti Terrorism laws.

                Initially this job was more focus on assisting with bookkeeping.
                Gradually the role evolved into an accountant assistant position
                where I could apply my previous experience. On top of
                bookkeeping and annual report building tasks, I also handled
                tasks related to COVID-19 compensation packages from the Danish
                Business Authorities.

                This job was a direct continuation of my trainee position. At
                this point my client portfolio increased and I also got two
                clients to report wages for on a monthly basis.
